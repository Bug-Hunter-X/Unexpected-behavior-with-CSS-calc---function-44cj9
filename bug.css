The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there can be subtle errors if spaces are not handled correctly.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px);` will likely cause unexpected results due to the space between `20` and `px`. Another error involves incorrect operator precedence when mixing units, or using unsupported units within the calculation.
